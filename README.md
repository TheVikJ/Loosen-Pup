# What Loosen Pup is
Loosen Pup is a Python program which reminds you to take a break every 45 minutes, and help de-stress (loosen up) with pictures of dogs randomly generated using the Dog API through the random-dog package. This large database practically guarantees a new doggo pic every time.
# Inspiration
**Everybody gets stressed. Everybody needs a break. Everybody loves doggos.**
On a serious note, I was getting really frustrated programming the original project that I had planned for this Hackathon, so I did what I always do to get over **PURE RAGE**. I looked at cute pictures of puppies. I also remember hearing one of my teachers telling me that the average attention span is around 45 minutes. Thus, I came up with the idea to make a program that tells you to take a break every 45 minutes _and_ shows you pictures of puppies to calm yourself and relax, and Loosen Pup was born.
# How Loosen Pup was built
Loosen Pup uses the **Dog API** through the **random-dog** python package. This large database practically guarantees a new doggo pic every time. It also uses the **time** package to remind you every 45 minutes to take a break, and the **os** package to delete the previous image (to avoid cluttering your desktop).
